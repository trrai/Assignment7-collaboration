# a7 - Collaboration

This repo contains R code for generating a report about students in an Informatics course, created as part of an assignment for the [Technical Foundations](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1100121) course at the UW iSchool.

The below questions should be answered regarding your assignment submission!

##### Which team members were responsible for which features? #####
Juhwan did part 1, Yash did part 2, Tejveer did parts 3 and 4.


_Note: If there are any issues with group collaboration, let me know now **before** the final project!_


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
Our group worked together to help each other and we occasionally asked our TA for assistance. 


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you (individually and as a group) to complete this assignment? #####
Individually, Part 1 and 2 took a few hours each and Parts 3 and 4 took around 6-7 hours. As a group we spent around 12-14 hours. 


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
The assignment was fairly open ended but I would say it's a 7/10 in difficulty.


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
There weren't many issues besides the occasional merge conflict or making sure all group members were on the same page.
